# Google_App_Rating_Prediction_Project

Problem Statement: I have a dataset containing features of apps present in the Google Play Store, and I am preparing a model to predict the rating.

Work Done: The App Rating Prediction Project in Python is an effort to develop a machine learning model and conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to accurately predict the user ratings of a given app. The project involves collecting user data from a CSV file and user demographics, and then using this data to build a predictive model.

Technologies Used

Python Jupyter Notebook Libraries:-

Numpy Pandas For visualization 

Seaborn Matplot For Scaling

Processing Min-Max scaler For Classification

Prediction: Scikit Learn: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)



Output: Rating predicted with the model with visualization.

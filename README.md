# Google_App_Rating_Prediction_Project

Problem Statement: I have a dataset containing features of apps present in google playstore, preparing a model to predt the rating.

Work done: The App Rating Prediction Project in Python is an effort to develop a machine learning model, and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) that can accurately predict the user ratings of a given app. The project involves collecting user data from a csv file, and user demographics, and then using this data to build a predictive model.

Technologies Used

Python Jupiter Notebook Libraries:-

Numpy Pandas For visualization 

Seaborn Matplot For Scaling

Processing min-max scaler For Classification

Prediction: Scikit learn: knn




Output: Rating predicted with the model with visualization.

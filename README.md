# Google_App_Rating_Prediction_Project

Objective: Make a model to predict the app rating, with other information about the app provided.


Problem Statement: Google Play Store team is about to launch a new feature wherein, certain apps that are promising, are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways including higher priority in recommendations sections (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). These will also get a boost in search results visibility.  This feature will help bring more attention to newer apps that have the potential.


Analysis done: The problem is to identify the apps that are going to be good for Google to promote. App ratings, which are provided by the customers, is always a great indicator of the goodness of the app.

The App Rating Prediction Project in Python is an effort to develop a machine learning model and conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to accurately predict the user ratings of a given app. The project involves collecting user data from a CSV file and user demographics, and then using this data to build a predictive model.


Technologies Used

Python Jupyter Notebook Libraries:-

Numpy Pandas For visualization 

Seaborn Matplot For Scaling

Processing Min-Max scaler For Classification

Prediction: Scikit Learn: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)



Output: Rating predicted with the model with visualization.
